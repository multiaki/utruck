# My trucking website idea
As a truck driver, I want to find a load from the closes warehouse. The loads need to
meet the certain criteria: weight, distance, price, time, availability. The idea is to
eliminate the dispatcher and let the truck driver find the load. I am proposing to make a
website that will be responsible for finding the load, filling out all necessary forms,
sending the load details to the truck driver’s mobile phone, and sending reminders when
delivery is due.

## Features
1. Show all loads from different warehouses
2. Filter by: weight, price, distance, availability
3. Fill out all forms that are necessary to get the load
4. Get location from the browser
5. Send reminders

## Market survey
1. https://www.dat.com/ - Expensive, no way to fill in the forms, tightly
attached to the dispatcher
2. https://www.appscrip.com/uber-for-trucks-convoy-clone-cargomatic-clone-trucker
path-clone-goshare-clone-doft-clone - A very good api, needs a lot of
programming skills. Too expensive to manage in a long run.
3. https://truckerpath.com - uses the best calculation method, requires a lot of
programming skills, not user friendly
4. https://123loadboard.com - easy to use, lacks functionalities
5. https://freight.uber.com - closest to my idea, doesn’t have fill in forms.
